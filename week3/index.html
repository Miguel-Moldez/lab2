<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p style ="background-color:lightpink;">Hi! My name is Allan Miguel O. Moldez and I'm a part of LGBTQ Community, Gay to be exact. Being able to express in terms of my sexuality without being discriminated and shamed feels freeing and loved in some ways. But being "different" not only put a target on my back but also question things about myself as well, and that is why I'm very grateful to to the people that surrounds me (My family and friends) that amidst all the hatred towards me and my community they still suport me for who I am. </p>
<p style ="background-color:SkyBlue;">Now, let's talk about School! I am currently a student of Asia Pacific College and an SM Scholar as well(Shocked that I was accepted but grateful nonetheless)! My major is BS in Computer Science with specialization in System Softwares. I'm very happy with the college and environment I chose and I can't wait to see what the future offers me.</p>
